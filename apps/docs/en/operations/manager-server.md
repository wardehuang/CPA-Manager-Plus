# Manager Server Guide

Manager Server is the backend for the full CPAMP experience. It hosts `management.html`, stores local SQLite data, consumes the CPA usage queue through the collector, and protects management capabilities with the CPAMP Admin Key.

When you open this entry point, you are using Manager Server mode:

```text
http://<host>:18317/management.html
```

When CPA itself serves this entry point, you are using the CPA-hosted panel compatibility mode:

```text
http://<cpa-host>:8317/management.html
```

The CPA-hosted panel does not read Manager Server SQLite and does not provide the full historical monitoring, model prices, API Key aliases, import/export, or server inspection history.

## What Manager Server Does

Manager Server:

- Serves the embedded management panel.
- Runs first setup or reads an environment-managed CPA connection.
- Authenticates users with the `cpamp_...` admin key.
- Encrypts setup/panel-saved CPA Management Keys with `data.key`.
- Proxies CPA Management API calls after setup.
- Consumes CPA usage events.
- Persists usage events in SQLite.
- Provides Dashboard, Request Monitoring, Usage Analytics, Model Pricing, API Key Alias, Usage Import/Export, and Server Codex Inspection APIs.

## Architecture

```text
Browser
  -> Manager Server :18317
      -> /management.html
      -> /usage-service/info
      -> /usage-service/config
      -> /v0/management/usage              from SQLite
      -> /v0/management/model-prices       from SQLite
      -> /v0/management/api-key-aliases    from SQLite
      -> /v0/management/dashboard/*        from SQLite
      -> /v0/management/monitoring/*       from SQLite
      -> /v0/management/codex-inspection/* from SQLite / background workers
      -> other /v0/management/*            proxied to CPA
      -> collector -> CPA usage queue
      -> /data/usage.sqlite
```

CPA still runs separately. CPAMP does not bundle CPA.

## First Setup And Login

On first startup, CPAMP needs an admin key. You can provide one:

```bash
CPA_MANAGER_ADMIN_KEY='replace-with-a-long-random-admin-key'
```

If not configured, Manager Server generates:

```text
cpamp_...
```

and prints it once in the startup logs.

First setup asks for:

```text
Admin Key
CPA URL
CPA Management Key
Request Monitoring
Collection Mode
Poll Interval
```

After setup:

- Browser login uses the CPAMP admin key.
- Setup/panel-saved CPA Management Keys are stored server-side and encrypted.
- In installer env/secret mode, Manager Server reads the CPA URL and CPA Management Key from the deployment environment.
- Manager Server uses the resolved CPA Management Key when calling CPA.
- New browsers no longer need the CPA Management Key.

## CPA Prerequisites

Request monitoring requires CPA usage publishing and the CPA usage queue.

Minimum:

```text
CPA v6.10.8+ for HTTP usage queue
```

Recommended:

```text
CPA v7.1.39+
```

CPA Management API must be enabled:

```yaml
remote-management:
  secret-key: "your CPA Management Key"
  allow-remote: true
```

Usage publishing can be enabled by CPAMP during setup/config save, or directly in CPA:

```yaml
usage-statistics-enabled: true
```

Queue retention is controlled by CPA:

```yaml
redis-usage-queue-retention-seconds: 60
```

Default retention is 60 seconds and the maximum is 3600 seconds. Keep Manager Server running continuously.

## Collection Mode

Default:

```text
auto
```

Behavior:

```text
auto -> RESP Pub/Sub -> HTTP usage queue -> RESP pop fallback
```

| Mode | Use when |
|---|---|
| `auto` | Recommended default. |
| `subscribe` | Force RESP Pub/Sub for low-latency direct CPA API access. |
| `http` | Force HTTP usage queue, useful behind normal HTTP reverse proxies. |
| `resp` | Force legacy RESP pop; must directly reach the CPA API port. |

RESP transports cannot pass through a normal HTTP reverse proxy. If you see `unsupported RESP prefix 'H'`, the RESP client is probably connecting to an HTTP endpoint.

## Configuration Boundary

Managed by Manager Server:

- Bound CPA URL.
- Encrypted CPA Management Key.
- Request monitoring switch.
- Collection mode, poll interval, batch size, and query limit.
- SQLite usage data.
- Model pricing data.
- API Key aliases.
- Server inspection history.

Still managed by CPA:

- `usage-statistics-enabled`
- `redis-usage-queue-retention-seconds`
- `remote-management`
- proxy and routing config
- logging config
- auth files
- provider config
- CPA `config.yaml`

Saving CPAMP configuration does not rewrite the full CPA `config.yaml`.

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `CPA_MANAGER_CONFIG` | empty | Optional config file path. Native packages default to `config.json` next to the binary. |
| `HTTP_ADDR` | `0.0.0.0:18317` | Manager Server listen address. |
| `USAGE_DATA_DIR` | Docker: `/data`; native: `./data` | Base data directory. |
| `USAGE_DB_PATH` | Docker: `/data/usage.sqlite`; native: `./data/usage.sqlite` | SQLite database path. |
| `CPA_MANAGER_ADMIN_KEY` | empty | Optional admin key. |
| `CPA_MANAGER_ADMIN_KEY_FILE` | `/run/secrets/cpa_admin_key` | Optional admin key file. |
| `CPA_MANAGER_DATA_KEY` | empty | Optional data encryption key. |
| `CPA_MANAGER_DATA_KEY_FILE` | `/run/secrets/cpa_data_key` | Optional data encryption key file. |
| `CPA_MANAGER_DATA_KEY_PATH` | Docker: `/data/data.key`; native: `./data/data.key` | Generated data key path. |
| `CPA_UPSTREAM_URL` | empty | Optional environment-managed CPA URL. |
| `CPA_MANAGEMENT_KEY` | empty | Optional environment-managed CPA Management Key. |
| `CPA_MANAGEMENT_KEY_FILE` | `/run/secrets/cpa_management_key` | Optional CPA Management Key file. |
| `USAGE_COLLECTOR_MODE` | `auto` | `auto`, `subscribe`, `http`, or `resp`. |
| `USAGE_RESP_QUEUE` | `usage` | RESP key argument; normally leave unchanged. |
| `USAGE_RESP_POP_SIDE` | `right` | `right` uses `RPOP`; `left` uses `LPOP`. |
| `USAGE_BATCH_SIZE` | `100` | Max records per batch. |
| `USAGE_POLL_INTERVAL_MS` | `500` | Idle poll interval. |
| `USAGE_QUERY_LIMIT` | `50000` | Max recent usage events. |
| `USAGE_CORS_ORIGINS` | `*` | CORS origins for compatibility endpoints. |
| `USAGE_RESP_TLS_SKIP_VERIFY` | `false` | Skip TLS verification for RESP connection. |
| `USAGE_QUOTA_COOLDOWN_ENABLED` | `false` | Enable the Codex usage-limit cooldown worker. |
| `USAGE_ACCOUNT_ACTIONS_ENABLED` | `false` | Enable the account action queue for auth issues that need review. |
| `USAGE_ACCOUNT_ACTIONS_AUTO_DISABLE` | `false` | Enable automatic disabling for auth issues. This only takes effect when the account action queue is enabled. |
| `PANEL_PATH` | empty | Optional custom `management.html`. |

Startup precedence:

```text
environment variables > config.json > defaults
```

When `USAGE_QUOTA_COOLDOWN_ENABLED`, `USAGE_ACCOUNT_ACTIONS_ENABLED`, or `USAGE_ACCOUNT_ACTIONS_AUTO_DISABLE` is set through the environment, the matching panel switch is shown as environment-sourced and locked. Remove the environment variable and restart Manager Server if you want the setting to be editable from the panel.

After setup, Manager Server management endpoints require:

```text
Authorization: Bearer <CPAMP_ADMIN_KEY>
```

## Data And Security

Back up:

```text
usage.sqlite
usage.sqlite-wal
usage.sqlite-shm
data.key
```

Security notes:

- The admin key is not stored in plaintext; only a salted HMAC credential is stored.
- CPA Management Keys saved through setup or the panel are encrypted before being stored in SQLite.
- If `usage.sqlite` leaks without `data.key`, the saved CPA Management Key is not directly readable.
- If both `usage.sqlite` and `data.key` leak, the saved CPA Management Key can be decrypted.
- If `data.key` is lost, the saved CPA Management Key cannot be recovered.
- If the CPA connection is env/secret-managed, also back up the secret files in the install directory.
- Request metadata may contain model names, endpoints, account labels, project snapshots, token usage, latency, and failure summaries.
- Raw failure bodies stay local in SQLite. Normal APIs and JSONL exports expose sanitized summaries instead of raw diagnostic bodies.

## Import And Export

Manager Server exports JSONL / NDJSON usage events.

It can import:

- JSONL / NDJSON exported by Manager Server.
- Legacy usage snapshots only when request-level details exist.

Aggregate-only legacy files cannot reconstruct request-level monitoring. Test imports against a backup or staging database when accuracy matters.
