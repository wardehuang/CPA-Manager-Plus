# Backup And Restore

CPAMP keeps request history, configuration, and encrypted credentials on the host. The common mistake is backing up only `usage.sqlite` and missing WAL/SHM files, `data.key`, or secret files in the install directory.

## Required Backup Files

Back up these files as a set:

- `usage.sqlite`
- `usage.sqlite-wal`
- `usage.sqlite-shm`
- `data.key`

If your deployment directory contains custom configuration files, back them up too. With the one-click installer, also back up `secrets/` under the install directory; full installation and env/secret-managed connections store the CPA Management Key in `secrets/cpa-management-key`.

## Why data.key Is Required

CPA connections saved through setup or the panel encrypt the CPA Management Key with `data.key` before saving it to SQLite.

- If only `usage.sqlite` leaks, an attacker cannot directly read the CPA Management Key.
- If both `usage.sqlite` and `data.key` leak, the CPA Management Key can be decrypted.
- If `data.key` is lost, the saved CPA Management Key cannot be recovered. You must save the CPA connection configuration again.

If the CPA connection is managed by environment variables or secret files, the CPA Management Key is not written to SQLite. Back up the related secret files together with the data directory.

## Docker Backup Example

If you use a named volume, stop the container first, then export through a temporary container:

```bash
docker stop cpa-manager-plus
docker run --rm \
  -v cpa-manager-plus-data:/data:ro \
  -v "$PWD":/backup \
  alpine \
  tar czf /backup/cpa-manager-plus-data.tgz -C /data .
docker start cpa-manager-plus
```

If you use a host directory mount:

```bash
docker stop cpa-manager-plus
cp -a /srv/cpa-manager-plus-data /srv/cpa-manager-plus-data.backup
docker start cpa-manager-plus
```

## Native Package Backup

Stop the process, then copy the data directory:

```bash
cp -a ./data ./data.backup
```

Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
Copy-Item -Recurse .\data .\data.backup
```

## Restore

1. Stop CPAMP.
2. Restore the full data directory.
3. Confirm that `usage.sqlite` and `data.key` come from the same backup.
4. If the CPA connection is env/secret-managed, also restore `secrets/` from the install directory.
5. Start CPAMP.
6. Log in and check configuration, monitoring data, and collector status.

If restore produces decryption errors, first check whether `data.key` matches the SQLite database.
